# Demos
Demonstration implementations of neural network image processing algorithms. Everything is written from scratch in C# and has no dependencies on third-party libraries. Windows XP and higher, .NET Framework 4.0 and higher are required to run. Windows 7 and .NET Framework 4.5 are recommended. Any bit depth.

# Important!

* All the presented implementations are inferior in performance to the corresponding author's code. All materials presented in this repository are intended solely for reference and are aimed at enabling neural networks to be run "out of the box" on home PCs, rather than for regular use. However, despite this, we are constantly working on optimization ;)
* The programs presented are extremely resource-intensive. Despite the theoretical possibility of running them on old PCs, you should not expect high code speed even on modern machines.
* Commercial use of some of the algorithms implemented here is prohibited by the authors. Carefully study the license in the official repositories!
* Detailed instructions for launching implementations can be found in the file: [MANUAL.md](https://github.com/ColorfulSoft/StyleTransfer-Colorization-SuperResolution/blob/master/MANUAL.md).
